We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG68X","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Nightmares From The Deep: The Cursed Heart","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26094.9007199266299955.b5e6da51-3cdc-43ab-a8f3-c04e502a7ef8.189ae27e-94dc-4896-bf04-29ebcba2d053","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"81","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.NightmaresfromtheDeepTheCursedHeart_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["1adf1dd2-ad18-01c9-5642-3a1d265e2bde"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nWould you like to enter a thrilling Pirates world where danger lurks in every corner?\r\n\r\nTRY IT FREE, THEN UNLOCK THE FULL ADVENTURE FROM WITHIN THE GAME!\r\n\r\nYou are a museum owner pursuing an undead pirate who kidnapped your daughter.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMKB9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FreeCell Solitaire!!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59065.9007199266455270.84bb2bf5-7dbb-40ad-80b8-8fc9a396e159.ec844391-b99f-4a18-9127-eb6ffdb8ba19","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60479.9007199266455270.aa4f2647-4a7b-4c3c-9232-336780d2445b.98431c0d-6ab8-4530-953f-18a7d9c13425","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25411.9007199266455270.eb33f1f4-7c99-4d6e-a377-585a709443a5.b551c48b-7487-406d-851a-c099efc9877a","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"white","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["476931bsyl.FreeCellSolitaire_cgv7566y2ek3j"],"ContentIds":["9b4df518-4a1f-85be-2f35-6d53450f7425","707fc4af-d0f3-1d37-2916-d5a60b344dd2","ce98bf80-46d6-f1d6-c5fb-7c712a9b69f8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This card game is a FreeCell Solitaire.\r\n\r\nSee the rules for more details:\r\n\r\nFreeCell is played with a deck of 52 cards, which are placed on eight columns in the middle.\r\nOn the left, there are 4 free cells you can use to place a card temporarly.\r\nThe goal is to build the 4 foundations on the right, from Ace to King.\r\nUsually, you would move cards one by one, helping with the free cells.\r\nThe game allows you to move several cards at once, provided you have enough free cells to complete the move.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDN78W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Type to Pop","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61120.9007199266464960.c3cea2db-c2a5-4128-b24d-09cdd43ec936.ec48dfee-5d44-4fcf-a3e3-460501e7abe9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0892d8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50156.9007199266464960.93249552-af2e-4f88-8690-c37e877f8d2b.88ae046e-a358-4abe-a62c-788d6dd37a92","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0892d8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["28111AshishMishra.TypetoPop_yx16r8sffspeg"],"ContentIds":["a9cd88fc-89f4-a6c8-6005-26b982df155d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a Typing Tutor  for kids.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCM3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"SoulCraft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26697.9007199266251390.e266595a-4058-42fc-b45d-aea1c944ec77.96411d1d-6eac-439d-98e6-a0e6744a5cf3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0d73d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38719.9007199266251390.edf570de-007f-4bd5-9f43-33b1dd2d778e.698ffbab-d654-42a8-a79e-3b993c20c85e","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0d73d2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"185","PackageFamilyNames":["MobileBitsGmbH.SoulCraft_n3knxnwpdbgdc"],"ContentIds":["22573932-81ef-fa16-95ab-ab97c2617f6e","e664d1ce-b6b8-6ea3-3202-fd7674d34c45"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SoulCraft is the best free2play Action RPG game for Windows 8.

numbers from 1 to 36 as well as the two zero slots, numbered 0 and 00.\r\n\r\nThe two zero slots are opposite each other on the wheel and consecutive numbers such as 1, 2 and 23, 24 also face each other. The two zeros are colored green and the rest of the numbers will alternate from red to black as we go round the wheel.\r\n\r\nAmerican Roulette Game Rules\r\n\r\n- American Roulette is a classic roulette game that features inside bets, outside bets, and favorite bets.\r\n- The roulette wheel has 38 slots numbered 0-36 with an additional 00. The object of the game is to predict which slot the ball will land in after the wheel is spun.\r\n- The minimum and maximum bets for the game are displayed on the MIN/MAX section of the table.\r\n- Payouts are made according to the Paytable. To view the Paytable, click the i-button in the keypad, alternatively see the Payout section below.\r\n\t\t\r\nHow to Play\r\n\r\nSelect a chip value, place your bets, spin the wheel, and wait to see if you have correctly predicted the winning number.\r\n\t\t\r\n- Selecting a chip value. To select the desired chip value, click a chip in the keypad area. If there are active arrows to the left and right of the chips, click these to see additional chip values.\r\n- You can point at different positions of the table to highlight the bets. When a bet position is highlighted, a window appears and displays the minimum and maximum bet limits for that bet.\r\n- Placing one or several bets. To place a bet, select the chip value and click either a number or a betting position on the table. Additional clicks add the required number of chips of the same value to the selected bet area.\r\n- After a bet is placed, you can point at the chips on the table to view the total value of the bet and the total payout if the bet wins.\r\n- Spinning the wheel. When you have finished betting, click the spin button to start a game round. The ball is then launched into the roulette wheel. The amount you bet is deducted from your account. The ball lands in a slot and the number on the slot is the winning number.\r\n- A player can stop the roulette wheel anytime while it is spinning, by clicking the spin button. This function is not available during Autoplay (not available in all casinos).\r\n- It is possible to spin the wheel without placing any bets (not available in all casinos).\r\n- Checking the winning number. When the ball lands in a slot, the winning number is announced and all winning bets are paid. The winning number is displayed on the roulette wheel. Your winnings are also displayed in the game panel and are added to your Cash amount. All losing bets are cleared from the table.\r\n- Playing again. Click the rebet button to place the same bet as in the previous round. Alternatively, click the clear all bets button to clear the table of all previous bets, place any new bets, and then click the spin button. For more information, refer to the Game Functions section below.\r\n\t\t\r\nAuto Adjust Bet\r\n\r\n- If a bet exceeds the bet limit or table limit, or if the player is out of money, the Auto Adjust Bet function automatically adjusts the bet to the highest possible amount. If the bet consists of several bet positions, it will be scaled down proportionally over the included bet positions. If the scaled down bet is too small to cover all desired bet positions, chips will be placed on as many of these positions as possible. If all desired bet positions cannot be covered, the game will randomly choose which positions should receive chips.\r\n- To activate this function, open the Game settings menu.\r\n\t\t\r\nFavourite Bets\r\n\r\n- The game has a favorite bets feature, which allows you to save bets of any configuration and place them automatically.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped.

Whilst simple in concept a good deal of strategy is required to complete the layouts.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from a layout in the least possible time. Layouts can vary in pattern, size and shape. Tiles are removed in pairs and may only be removed if they are both free and match one another. Free tiles are ones that have no other piece touching the left, right or both sides and no tiles on top.\r\n\r\nWhilst all deals generated by Mahjongg are solvable you will need to remove pairs of tiles carefully to ensure you don’t stop the removal of remaining pairs. \r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads. Experience speed that cannot be stopped by anything less than a brick wall!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST\r\nFeel the adrenaline overload as you start racing against the biker gangs that rule The City. They are the famous 1%, the outlaw bike racers who thrive on crime and their need for the rush of speed. They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters. Except for power and money, of course.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nCustomize your bike with unique tuning - slap some decals and paint it with your favourite color. Go crazy with the combinations, it’s your ride - your rules. In illegal drag racing competitions being creative about your bike is the only way to become known and respected.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE URBAN SPRAWL\r\nThe City is split into districts, each run by a different bike gang. You’ll have to beat all of the renegade bikers if you hope to assume direct control over The City. Race in a deep selection of realistic game modes and challenges.\r\n\r\nBECOME A LEGEND OF THE ROAD\r\nThe great highway awaits for those brave enough to compete with the best racing competitors in the world of underground bike community. You have to be hardcore to keep up with the criminal kings of the road - but the prize for the best moto racer is really big. Do you think you can become the new bike gang leader of The City?\r\n\r\nEASY RIDER\r\nThis bike racing game is optimized to work smooth on most devices. Additionally it was translated into 17 languages from all over the world. Nothing can stop you from owning the streets now!\r\nSee you on the road, player!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,
