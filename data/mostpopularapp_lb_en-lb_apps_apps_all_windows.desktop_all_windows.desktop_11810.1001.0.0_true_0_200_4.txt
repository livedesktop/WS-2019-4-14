\r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n* Natural signing experience like pen on paper — While signing on the screen the signature is displayed without delay and accurately like signing with a pen on paper. \r\n\r\n* 'xyzmo' does not require an internet connection\r\n\r\n* Forensically identifiable signatures — xyzmo Signature Capture records the signature of a person using all available parameters, such as acceleration, speed, and rhythm. If there is a dispute about a captured signature, an expert tool is available to forensically analyze the biometric characteristics of the captured signature. \r\n\r\n* Document binding - When a signature, including all these biometric parameters, is captured locally on the device, it is safely embedded using an asynchronous public key encryption and uniquely bound to the target PDF document. Copy/paste attacks can thus be easily detected. \r\n\r\n* No proprietary e-signature technology: xyzmo is based on the open PDF standards and true digital signatures\r\n\r\n* No vendor lock-in: You don't need to come to the xyzmo website to check the validity of documents\r\n\r\n* xyzmo Signature Capture is part of the SIGNificant platform which allows you to choose the ideal e-signature deployment and integration for any type of process or channel. You can deploy locally or server-based, on-premises or in our private cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease contact us at sales@xyzmo.com if you are interested in our SIGNificant platform or want to integrate the capabilities into your own app. Alternatively you can call us at +1-201-205-291-8 or +43-7229-88060.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRHM0","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"GoPro Channel","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9963.9007199266561593.56e5fbbb-2851-4a38-94ac-54dc1ba90ba8.fcfa218b-8c5a-4c73-b741-4c0b276e8b1f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21486.9007199266561593.aa126205-f452-4c38-a4e5-2f0b54c2f54c.c68d5126-f27a-4a55-ab92-bec59ab6e441","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39886.9007199266561593.41c7b706-383c-48b2-b525-e53ca39df072.3d4487a0-79d0-4127-9c91-80bf8589f5f0","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2310.9007199266561593.4913587e-640c-44dd-a697-04ea69956e3c.acbf4090-22d7-4ea6-adbd-414f79eef49d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28212.9007199266561593.2e89bb2b-a545-406d-b5a8-a71752d26343.d65994c2-d4f8-4c9e-a176-f47678bc375c","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59049.9007199266561593.7ef7326d-c7c2-4825-aabb-bff8d7af2519.eb9123dd-89dc-4b5c-bf22-c27986c9279f","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GoPro.GoProChannel_1h9vz9xjm6b8c"],"ContentIds":["c23bd125-290a-cfa7-5598-8c2134e1dc04"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to the GoPro Channel on Windows 8.1.

Setting up this environment will allow you to validate your application’s behavior while running under WIP. For more information about WIP and how it works, please go here: https://technet.microsoft.com/itpro/windows/keep-secure/protect-enterprise-data-using-wip \r\n\r\nPlease note: WIP setup developer assistant needs to be run as an administrator. It requires administrator access to your VM to apply WIP policy.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n1.\tFirst, install the WIP setup developer assistant on a VM. We recommend that you use a VM because it’s probably not managed by other competing protection policies. After you’ve got a VM, we recommend that you create a checkpoint on it before you run the app  apply a policy.\r\n2.\tDefine your policy by adding information to each section in the WIP setup developer assistant. All sections are required except Enterprise Cloud Resources and your allowed lists of programs however, you will need to allow some applications in order to see WIP behavior. Choose the help icon (i) next to any setting to learn more about how to use it. \r\na.\tTo generate a DRA certificate, open a command prompt and type this command: cipher /r: certname. certname is any name that you want to give your certificate.  Respond to each prompt to give your certificate a password.  After you’ve generated the certificate, you can choose it in the “Choose a Data Recovery Certificate” File setting of the WIP setup developer assistant. \r\nb.\tYou’ll have to Install your desktop apps or Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps on the VM before you can browse and add them to the policy. \r\nc.\tTo create an AppLocker policy for a desktop app, use the Select Programs button to point to the .exe file in the app folder structure.\r\nd.\tTo create an AppLocker policy for a UWP app, choose the Select Packages button to locate the package of your app. Your app appears in this list only if the UWP is already installed on the VM either from the store or side loaded.\r\n3.\tWhen you’re done, choose the Apply Changes button.
